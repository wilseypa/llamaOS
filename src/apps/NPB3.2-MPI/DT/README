Data Traffic benchmark DT is new in the NPB suite 
(released as part of NPB3.2-MPI package).
----------------------------------------------------

DT is written in C and same executable can run on any number of processors,
provided this number is not less than the number of nodes in the communication
graph).  DT benchmark takes one argument: BH, WH, or SH. This argument 
specifies the communication graph Black Hole, White Hole, or SHuffle 
respectively. The current release contains verification numbers for 
CLASSES S, W, A, and B only.  Classes C and D are defined, but verification 
numbers are not provided in this release.
