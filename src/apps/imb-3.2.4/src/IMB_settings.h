/*
IMB settings definitions

There are two scenarios to run IMB

IMB_STANDARD:
"Mandatory" settings

IMB_OPTIONAL:
The user can change the settings, in order to extend the table of benchmark
results. Changeable are only a few crucial parameters for IMB.

Overall, at most 8 preprocessor varibales can bet set in order to control
IMB. These are

- IMB_OPTIONAL (has to be set when user optional settings are to be activated)

- MINMSGLOG    (second smallest data transfer size is 2^MINMSGLOG (the smallest
                always being 0))

- MAXMSGLOG    (largest message size is 2^MAXMSGLOG)

- MSGSPERSAMPLE (max. repetition count)

- MSGS_NONAGGR  (     "      for non aggregate benchmarks)

- OVERALL_VOL   (for all sizes < OVERALL_VOL, the repetition count is eventually
                reduced so that not more than OVERALL_VOL bytes overall are 
                processed.
                This avoids unnecessary repetitions for large message sizes.

                Finally, the real repetition count for message size X is

                MSGPERSAMPLE (X=0),

                min(MSGSPERSAMPLE,max(1,OVERALL_VOL/X))    (X>0)

                NOTE: OVERALL_VOL does NOT restrict the size of the max. 
                data transfer. 2^MAXMSGLOG is the largest size, independent
                of OVERALL_VOL
               )

!! New in IMB_3.2: max. timing per experiment
- SECS_PER_SAMPLE
                Number of iterations is dynamically set so that this number
                of run time seconds is not exceeded per message length

- N_WARMUP      Number of "Warmup" sweeps (see the documentation)
- N_BARR        Number of MPI_Barrier for synchronization

- TARGET_CPU_SECS
                CPU seconds (as float) to run concurrent with nonblocking
                benchmarks
